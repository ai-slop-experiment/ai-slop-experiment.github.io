# Contributing to AI Slop Experiments

This project is for fun! The goal is to maximize AI-generated code ("slop") with minimal human review.

### Rules:

1.  **Frontend only:** Only HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript.
2.  **No network requests:** The code must not `fetch()`, use `XMLHttpRequest`, or load external scripts.
3.  **No `eval()`:** Obfuscated code is automatically rejected.
4.  **No human review:** Your PR will be automatically checked and merged by a bot if it passes the automated safety rules.
